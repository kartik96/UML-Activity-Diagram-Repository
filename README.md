# UML-Activity-Diagram-Repository

Activity diagrams (AD) are the basic flow diagrams used for depicting the behaviour of the system and the activities involved in performing any particular job. Usually one may find activity diagrams in which only one or two fork joins are there with few sub-queues and activity nodes in it. Standard examples available on the internet are ATM, hotel reservation, banking, etc. The schema for these ADs is small for validating any new algorithm in the field of model-based testing. In the context of ADs, there is a scarcity of standard existing benchmark repositories or models. Therefore, we have taken this as an opportunity to build one free repository where ADs with multiple fork-join nodes are available with at least 40 activity nodes under fork-join. These ADs also include nested structures and control constructs.

This repository is an initiative taken by the faculty from Computer Science & Engineering, Thapar University, Patiala (Vinay Arora) (vinay.arora@thapar.edu) and his B.E. students who had studied Software Engineering from him. Main student contributors are Mr. Kartik Gogia (kartikgogia42@gmail.com) and Mr. Jashanjot Sidhu (isidhu96@gmail.com) from 2018 batch of B.E. Software Engineering from CSE Department of Thapar University, Patiala.

Here, in this repository, the folder name denotes the subject undertaken for drawing AD. One main folder further constitute files like, .docx file having scenario explanation, .emx file having AD drawn using rational software architect (RSA) tool, image file for AD, and XMI file corresponding to AD.

In near future we will upload more AD that can be used by the academicians in their respective fields!

Use it and Share it!
